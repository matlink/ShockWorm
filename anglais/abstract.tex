\section{Abstract}
The goal of this project is to build a computer worm able to travel alone in a network of computers, using security holes available in the remote systems it tries to access.
Once done, I will have to study its movements in a secured network starting by infecting one machine. I will then improve its abilities to move and hide regarding the results I obtain. 
No anti-worm has been asked of me, however if time allows, I'll develop one in order to block its progression and destroy any trace of it on the systems it has infected.
