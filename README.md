# ShockWorm 

ShockWorm is a ShellShock based worm written in Perl. It's a project I realized during my first year of Master Informatique in the University of Caen Basse-Normandie.

First of all, it is a proof-of-concept to show how easy it is to write a such harmful worm based on the ShellShock vulnerability discovered in September 2014. Hopefully, most of the bash-using machines have been patched, however we shouldn't forget non-updated machines like smartphones, IP cameras, forsaken servers and so. 

This worm is willingly not harmful, and I hope noone will use it badly. In any case, I'm not responsible of any damages caused by this worm if it's thrown into the Internet by any other person than me. Don't do such things, let bad boys make their own instance.

Except inside the worm file, every documentation is written in french. I'm sorry, try to learn french, you'll see it's cool =)

If you need some more infos about this worm, want to improve it, or for any other questions about this (or not), you can contact me on this address : matlink@matlink.fr
